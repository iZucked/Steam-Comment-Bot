/**
 * A base class for fitness components which use a discount factor. Perhaps this
 * should instead be a helper class outside the hierarchy, but it's lightweight,
 * so not too much trouble to move if it becomes a problem.
 * 
 * When a typical subclass is calculating its fitness, it should probably call
 * {@link AbstractDiscountedFitnessComponent#resetAccumulator()} to clear the
 * accumulator, and then during fitness calculation it should call
 * {@link AbstractDiscountedFitnessComponent#addDiscountedValue(int, long)} to
 * add the different costs it sees at different times to the accumulator.
 * 
 * The total discounted fitness can then be recovered using
 * {@link AbstractDiscountedFitnessComponent#getAccumulator()}; in the default
 * implementation the {@link IFitnessComponent#getFitness()} method just returns
 * this value, but you may (indeed, probably will) want to override it instead.
 * 
 * Users of an {@link AbstractDiscountedFitnessComponent} can use the
 * {@link AbstractDiscountedFitnessComponent#setDiscountCurve(ICurve)} method to
 * provide a discount curve. If no discount curve is set, the {@link UnitCurve}
 * is used, which has the effect of making this class a dumb accumulator with a
 * little overhead. It may also introduce numerical error, because the
 * conversion is done with floating-point arithmetic at the moment. Perhaps
 * scaled integer arithmetic would be better.
 * 
 * TODO deal with MAX_VALUE
