/**
 * The {@link IReducingConstraintChecker} is an extended version of an {@link IConstraintChecker}. A {@link IConstraintChecker} which also implements {@link IReducingConstraintChecker} permits some
 * constraint violations providing that the number of violations does not increase. This permits the optimisation to start with a less than ideal situation and not make it worse. For example, let's
 * assume only 4 out of a set of 8 sequence elements are permitted in the solution. However a user has constructed an initial solution with 5 of these elements. Normally this would be rejected as an
 * invalid solution, but if we implements the {@link IReducingConstraintChecker} interface we can record the initial count of 5 and use that as the limit rather than 4 and permit the optimisation to
 * continue and remove the element. As the count reduces, the constraint checker can revert back to normal behaviour.
