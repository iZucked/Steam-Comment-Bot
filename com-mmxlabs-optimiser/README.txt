Reports
-------

This project is configured to generate FindBugs and Cobertura reports. FindBugs 
performs static code analysis to pick up common errors. Cobertura is a code 
coverage plugin to report on how much of the code is covered by unit tests. 
Note: This only means the code has been touched by code paths in unit tests - 
not that there is a specific test for the code.

These reports are generated as part of the site goal.
