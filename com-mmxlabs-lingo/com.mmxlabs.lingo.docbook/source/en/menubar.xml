		The Menu Bar
	</title>
	<para>The main menu bar provides access to commands which are
		usually
		applicable, whichever part of the application window you
		are using.
		The menus available from
		the main menu bar are “File”,
		“Edit”,
		“Data”, “Window” and “Help”.

	</para>
	<para>The “File” menu on the main menu bar shows some standard
		commands for managing scenarios. These allow a scenario (or all
		scenarios at once) to be closed,
		saved, or renamed. Note that
		there
		is no command for creating a new scenario or opening one on the
		filesystem: to open a scenario, it must be dragged into the
		Scenario
		Navigator from a Windows folder, or be copy-and-pasted
		into the
		Scenario Navigator.
	</para>
	<para>
		New scenarios must be created by importing from CSV data.

	</para>
	<para>The “Edit” menu allows the most recent command to be undone
		(and undone commands to be re-applied), as well as providing
		standard “Cut”, “Copy”, “Paste”,
		“Delete” and “Select All”
		commands.
	</para>
	<para>
		The “Data” menu provides commands for importing some common data
		across one or more scenarios simultaneously. LNG price indices,
		charter pricing, and base
		fuel
		pricing can all be imported from a
		matching CSV file using the Bulk Import dialog.

	<para>
		The “Window” menu allows switching between perspectives and
		selecting Views for Display.

	</para>
	<para>Tip: Use the View sub-menu to retrieve views that have been
		closed accidentally.
	</para>
	<para>Tip: Use Reset perspective to return the screen to its
		default
		layout.
