	<para>Each charter opportunity defines a charter-in and/or a
		charter-out market for vessels of the selected vessel classes.
	</para>
	<para>A charter-in market requires a charter in price curve and the
		number of options per selected class to create. Each option is
		modelled as a vessel available
		for the duration of the scenario
		(but
		only used to cover the cargoes assigned to it).
	</para>
	<para>A charter-out market defines a charter out price curve and a
		minimum duration. Charter outs are created in ballast idle times.
		If
		a
		vessel was travelling at
		full speed on the ballast leg and
		the
		remaining idle time is greater than the minimum charter duration,
		then this time can be considered for chartering out.
	</para>
	<para>Charter outs can be restricted from occurring before a
		particular date using the extra drop-down menu from the toolbar.
