		Markets Tab
	</h2></div></div></div><p>The Markets tab shows the three types of curve data used in
		LiNGO. These are Base Fuel curves, Chartering curves and Commodity
		Curves.
	</p><p>Curves are represented by a price for each calendar month.
		They
		can be defined as such or, for commodity curves, be derived
		from a
		simple expression such as
		&#8220;99%HH&#8221;. Missing values are
		assumed to be
		the same as the previous month (or the month before
		if that is also
		missing, and so on). Thus the last value in a
		curve
		is used for all
		dates in the future. Values can be edited or added
		directly in the
		table or imported in bulk. The add button (the
		green plus icon) in
		the
		table
		toolbar has an option to add
		additional dates to the table.
	</p><p>Base Fuel curves are typically $/MT of base fuel, such as HFO
		or
		MGO. Note, LiNGO currently prices base fuel at the first value
		in
		the
		curve regardless of
		date.
	</p><p>Chartering curves are typically $/day rates for chartering in
		or
		out a vessel.
	</p><p>Commodity curves are the various market indices and derived
		curves. Slot and contract price expressions can reference these
		curves. Typically priced as
		$/mmBtu.
	</p><p>Note: the units column is a free text field for information
		purposes. Changing it does not affect LiNGO in any way.
