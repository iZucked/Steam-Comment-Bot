			&#8220;Commercial&#8221;
			tab of the editor. New simple contracts can be added
			using the green

			contracts cannot be added this way

		</p><p>The next contract editor is split into three tabs: Contract,
			Pricing and Restrictions.
		</p><p></p><p>The pricing tab is specific to the type of contract. By default
			LiNGO ships with a price expression contract. This type of contract
			has a text field where
			simple expressions based around market curves
			can be defined. E.g. 99% HH+0.5&nbsp;means take 99% of HH curve price
			and
			add 50 cents (assuming the HH curve is in
			dollars). More complex
			contracts can have many other fields specific to that
			implementation.
		</p><p></p><p>The Contract tab contains various general information about the
			contract, while the Restrictions tabs allows for restrictions on
			transactions at the
			&#8220;other end&#8221; of the trade by port, contract or
			other characteristics.
