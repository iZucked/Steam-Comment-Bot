/**
 * Calculate voyage details for LNG vessels. Typically LNG vessels are dual fuel vessels, burning their own base fuel (such as heavy-fuel oil (HFO) or marine diesel oil (MDO)) and are capable of
 * burning LNG boil-off as an alternative. LNG is always boiling off and the alternative is to vent it. On laden voyages, LNG vessels will almost always be running on LNG boil-off (NBO) but this does
 * not provide enough energy to travel at full speed and in such cases the additional energy requirements will come from base fuel or by force boiling off (FBO) more LNG. LNG is often cheaper than
 * base fuel and so it is usually desirable to use LNG over base fuel.
