<h1>Schedule View <img src="../../icons/schedule_view.gif"></h1>
<p>The schedule view provides a visual representation of the schedule. Each row represents a vessel showing the sequence of cargoes, drydocks, charter outs and other events in time.</p>
<p>Selecting an element in the view will cause the other reports and editor to &quot;snap&quot; to that element if possible. For example selecting a load or discharge event will cause the relevant cargo to be highlighted in the cargo report. Additionally, the properties view will show additional details about the event. A summary will be shown in the tooltip which is displayed when hovering over an event.</p>
